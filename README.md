This is EvilMog's misc rule file and debug data repo

With generated2.rule being cited I thought it would be best
to release some of the original technical data to the world

There are also some GPU testing rules that are effective
against fast hashes.  They are not efficient but they are
effective.  Please let me know if you like them and feel
free to use these in derivative works, just make a PR to
add a citations file in the repo or send me a tweet @evil_mog

rule research
