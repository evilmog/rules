omgwtfbbq.rule:
This is a massive fule file collected from various sources designed for GPU
burnin and a rule file of last resort

expanded-cutb.rule:
This is a rule file where a massive wordlist from various sources was fed
into expander, cutb and then PACK was used to generate possible candidate
rules comparing the output of expander/cutb and the original wordlist.
This rule is not very efficient but it great as a rule of last resort on
fast hashes.
